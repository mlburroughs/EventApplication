# Evento

Evento is an event management and ticketing application. This service allows users to register for local events across the United States.

Upon opening the application, the user is presented with the first page of all events. Through a series of filters, the user is able query according to city, event type, event category, and organizer. The user is able to create a login profile that is used in the internal identity verfication service.

This project utilizes microservices (catalog, token, cart, order) and a WebMVC client to create scalable and deployable containers using Docker Compose.

Below are video demonstrations of project milestones:
