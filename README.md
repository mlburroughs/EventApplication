# Evento
Evento is an event management and ticketing application. This service allows users to browse, register and create local events across the United States.

Upon opening the application, the user is presented with the first page of all events. Through a series of filters that include city, the user is able query according to city, event type, event category, and organizer. The user is able to create a login profile that is used in the internal identity verfication service.

This project utilizes microservices (catalog, token, cart, order) and a WebMVC client to create scablable and deployable containers using Docker Compose.
